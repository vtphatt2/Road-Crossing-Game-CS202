# Road-Crossing-Game-CS202
In this project, my team will apply Object-oriented programming concepts to build a "cross the road" game

# Coding Rules
- Whenever you code a new feature, you should create a new branch for your work.

- Commit rule : 
    git commit -m "[folder that you change]/[file that you change] - message"
    For example :
        if you changed file "road.cpp" in folder named "Road" to change the size of the road, then you commit command should be :
            git commit -m "Road/road.cpp - Change the size of road"
        
- Don't try to comment every line of code, instead of that, please try make your code meaningful.
